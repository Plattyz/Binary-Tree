# How does a node binary tree works?

Simple thing. Let me put a context.

A tree basically have a main node (Root) , a middle node, a right node and a left node (Childs). Each middle node is a left or right node and has a left and a right node too.

Every middle node is eather a left node or a right node from another middle node or the left or right node of our main node.

For this example, our main node will be 10.

So here, we will have the left node and the right node. Our right node will be, for example, 15 and our left node will be 5.

We gonna try to find 20 in this node tree.

The right node, which is 15, will become a middle node which will also have a left and a right node. The right node will be *20* and the left node will be 13 (For example).

The left node will also have a right and a left node for itself. Its left not will be 3 and his right node will be 8 (For example).

We found 20 in the node tree, but it won't always be that easy. This was only an example.

This is an example of ![Alt text]Node Tree(https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/pariwiseswapnodes.png)

Good luck on understanding my say lol.
